00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,625
<i>For the people!</i>

2
00:00:55,417 --> 00:01:02,417
<i>- For the people!
- For the people!</i>

3
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,417
<i>- For the people!
- For the people!</i>

4
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,458
Let's go!

5
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,875
Welcome to the Doi Boy Club.

6
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,917
Hey, one martini, please.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,125
- Come here.
- Hey.

8
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:56,208
The first model is Aui.
He's got a hot body.

9
00:01:56,292 --> 00:02:00,583
This is Lert. I have to say he's gorgeous.

10
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,208
Next one, please.

11
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:08,583
This is Korn. He's new.
He has been here for less than two months.

12
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,292
He's covered in tattoos.

13
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,667
Okay.

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,000
This is Nui. He's still a college student.

15
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:22,708
He dreams of producing movies.
He's still young.

16
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,542
Are you ready for our special show?

17
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,375
If you are, please give us
a round of applause.

18
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,750
<i>Fuck you.</i>

19
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,167
Do you want to be top or bottom today?

20
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:31,667
See you later.

21
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,375
Bye.

22
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,833
Som, why are you still up?

23
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,292
The doctor told you to rest a lot.

24
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,208
I was waiting for you.

25
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,542
Why are you home late again?

26
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,375
I don't have enough money for tuition.

27
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,208
I have no money. I have nothing.

28
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:35,583
BOOZER KARAOKE

29
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,083
<i>Mister, how many of you are here today?</i>

30
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:53,667
<i>Mister, can I sit with you?</i>

31
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,500
<i>You are a generous man</i>

32
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,042
<i>You give me a garland</i><i>every time you come</i>

33
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,917
<i>May I ask how many garlands
You are giving me today?</i>

34
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,625
<i>Mister, you came so late today</i>

35
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:12,083
<i>Mister, I got sleepy waiting for you</i>

36
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:16,458
<i>Do you believe that I haven't got
a single garland today?</i>

37
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,333
<i>I'm starving to death</i>

38
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:23,083
<i>Because I was waiting for you</i>

39
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,042
BOOZER KARAOKE

40
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,125
WELCOME

41
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,583
See you later, Mister.

42
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,083
Bee, come home with me.

43
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,583
- I can't.
- Bee, come home with me.

44
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,500
Mister, I'll go with you.

45
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,167
Bee is on her period.
It will be a bloody sight.

46
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,292
I'll go with you. Come on.

47
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,042
- See you later.
- Bee.

48
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,208
Let's go.

49
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,792
I thought you were going with him.

50
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,042
Nonsense.

51
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,667
I would have if I wanted to.

52
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,833
I'd rather ride on the back of your bike.

53
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,458
You look much prettier like this.

54
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,792
Don't sweet talk me.

55
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,542
Give me a massage.

56
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,000
Where would you like me to massage you?

57
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,750
Here.

58
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,042
Sorn.

59
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,042
I have something for you.

60
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,125
What is it?

61
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,500
Let me help you with the rent.

62
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,917
Do you have money?

63
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,280
Of course, I just gave you some.

64
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,792
Go lie on the bed.

65
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,125
Do you want to be top or bottom today?

66
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Top.

67
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:11,583
ASSASSINATION

68
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,792
Let me go.

69
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,042
<i>Let me go.</i>

70
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,625
<i>Sorn.</i>

71
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,042
Yes.

72
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,000
Sorn.

73
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,375
Which shirt should I go with?
This or this?

74
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,292
This one.

75
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,625
Do you believe me?

76
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,542
Of course. Why else would I ask you then?

77
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,500
Why? Did you randomly pick one?

78
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,167
No.

79
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,167
The other one was too revealing,

80
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,792
but it looked nicer.

81
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,292
So the other one it is.

82
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,667
- Is your body ready?
- Yes.

83
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,375
- Is your heart ready?
- Yes.

84
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,458
Is your money ready?

85
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,250
No.

86
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,042
That's too bad
because we are doing it today.

87
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,934
PACKAGE DELIVERY AND MONEY TRANSFER
SERVICE TO SHAN STATE

88
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,679
MONEY EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER
MYANMAR-THAILAND

89
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,750
Take a seat.

90
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,356
Did you bring the required documents?

91
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,500
Birth certificate,

92
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,708
a copy of your employer's
house registration,

93
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,417
and a copy of your employer's
national ID card.

94
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,167
We don't have anything.
Can we still use your service?

95
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, it will cost you extra
since you don't have documents.

96
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,958
Normally, you must extend
your work permit every year

97
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,542
and report yourselves

98
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,083
to the immigration department
every three months.

99
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,083
Did you know

100
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,167
any of this?

101
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,333
Not at all?

102
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,375
It's okay.

103
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,958
Come to me for help when the time comes.

104
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,125
I have a question.

105
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,125
Can I go on an airplane
once I have a passport?

106
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,542
Yes, of course.

107
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:59,667
You must board the plane from Thailand

108
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,083
or go back to Myanmar first.

109
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:05,542
But it's easier to just cross the border.

110
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,958
How much is it?

111
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:09,167
It's 20,000 bahts.

112
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,458
<i>Sorn.</i>

113
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,667
Sorn.

114
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:38,667
Sorn.

115
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,292
Sorn, you are daydreaming again.

116
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,042
Nineteen, twenty.

117
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,500
All 20,000 bahts are here.

118
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,250
Are you doing it too?

119
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,208
It's 20,000 bahts.

120
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,583
- Thank you, Nan.
- You are welcome.

121
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:12,542
KORWAN CO., LTD.

122
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm broke now.

123
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,833
It's fine.

124
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,875
Call Ji, your client.

125
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,083
"Ji, give me some money.

126
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:23,875
Ji, I need money
to buy a new phone, please."

127
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,125
Fuck you, Korn.

128
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,250
Take this.

129
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,833
I can lift my legs.

130
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,375
How about a race?

131
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,458
Come on.

132
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,833
What are you doing?

133
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,542
Go.

134
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,458
Everyone.

135
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,125
Recently,

136
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,958
the government made an announcement

137
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,250
to close down entertainment venues
for 14 days.

138
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,292
It includes

139
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,583
our Doi Boy Club.

140
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,500
- This sucks.
- What do we do?

141
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,333
- This is unacceptable.
- It's not our fault.

142
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,750
- Other people caused the problem.
- This sucks.

143
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,125
What if my dad needs money?

144
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,351
Aren't they going to help us?

145
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,625
They took a lot of our money.
Where's the help?

146
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,229
- How are we supposed to survive?
- All right, everyone. Be quiet.

147
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,458
Anyway,

148
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,083
I'll do my best to help all of you.

149
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:41,042
Since today is our last day
before the break,

150
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,417
our club will be packed.

151
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:47,375
Let's get ready. Come on.
Customers will be here soon.

152
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:53,542
- We will be jobless.
- Yes.

153
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,542
No.

154
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,708
It's okay. It's on me.

155
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,333
One crispy noodle with gravy sauce to-go
for his wife, please.

156
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,417
Sure.

157
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,667
Hello, Ji.

158
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,125
What brings you here, Joe?

159
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,667
You know why I'm here.

160
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,417
Think about it.

161
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,500
You did a perfect job

162
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,958
last time.

163
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,250
You were untraceable
and impossible to catch.

164
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,625
You know what will happen to you

165
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
if you don't take this job, don't you?

166
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,125
I came here to warn you.

167
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,542
I don't want you to end up
like the last guy.

168
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,083
I still want you to go home
to your wife and kid.

169
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,083
Now that you are about to be a dad,
you should think carefully.

170
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,375
Take him to the car.

171
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,708
Let me go.

172
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,375
Let me go, fucker.

173
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,833
Let me go.

174
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,208
Hello, Joe.

175
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,458
I'll take the job.

176
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:05,042
How's life as a soldier?

177
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,792
Well, it isn't any different
from when I was a monk.

178
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,375
<i>Everybody wakes up,</i>

179
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,125
<i>eats,</i>

180
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>and sleeps at the same time.</i>

181
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:32,417
<i>Chiang Mai is a province
located in the north of Thailand</i>

182
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,417
<i>with an area of approximately
20,107 sq km…</i>

183
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,917
I need all of you to enlist
and fight for our nation.

184
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,917
We are happy as monks.

185
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,292
Don't force them to leave the monkhood.

186
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,208
We either kill them or get killed.

187
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,375
Let me ask you this.

188
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,125
Didn't the Shan people suffer

189
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,833
when Myanmar robbed our food
and burned down our city?

190
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,292
Are you just going to hide in the temple?

191
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,333
What choice do we have?

192
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,125
None.

193
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,042
We don't have a choice.

194
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,792
Why don't we flee to Thailand?

195
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,375
It's very close to here.

196
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,583
But you might

197
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,917
not be able to come back again.

198
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,417
Let's go. Screw this city-saving shit.

199
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,958
It's easier said than done.

200
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,792
You are daydreaming.

201
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,292
I don't mind how things are now.

202
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,667
We have a place to sleep and food to eat.

203
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,000
Do you even know anyone in Thailand?

204
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,542
Have you got your food
and shelter figured out?

205
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,708
No, I have not.

206
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,417
You are inviting me
when you don't have anything figured out.

207
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
You don't even have a plan.

208
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,417
I'm not going with you.

209
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,917
Are you really fleeing?

210
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,500
Are you coming with me?

211
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,250
I'll get going then.

212
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,167
Wan.

213
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,542
Are you seriously leaving me here?

214
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,750
I want you to come with me,

215
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,000
but you won't

216
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,167
so I'm choosing what's best for my future.

217
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,125
<i>How did you start working here?</i>

218
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:39,125
I worked many jobs before this one, Ji.

219
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:42,750
I used to be a construction worker
and a server.

220
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,417
<i>I saved up money.</i>

221
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,042
<i>My friend named Korn and I</i>

222
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,958
<i>hired a driver</i>

223
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,083
<i>to take us to Chiang Mai.</i>

224
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,083
Boys, wake up. We are here.

225
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,750
Korn.

226
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,333
Come quick.

227
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,208
Come.

228
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,083
Come quick.

229
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Come here.

230
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,042
Get in.

231
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,125
Get in there.

232
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:25,625
Hurry up.

233
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,167
What for?

234
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,625
Don't ask. Just get in.

235
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,500
<i>Hey, young man.</i>

236
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,042
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

237
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,917
<i>I haven't seen you in Thailand
for a while.</i>

238
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,542
<i>What goods are you delivering today?</i>

239
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,333
<i>Groceries, as usual.</i>

240
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,667
<i>- Can I take a look?
- Go ahead.</i>

241
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:21,667
<i>I was informed by word of mouth
that this job paid well</i>

242
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,375
<i>so I decided to give it a try.</i>

243
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:45,833
- Hello.
- Hello.

244
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,208
Hi, are you here to apply for a job?

245
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:50,125
- Yes.
- What's your name?

246
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,792
I'm Korn.

247
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,083
I'm Wan.

248
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,208
Wan?

249
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,500
Wan again?

250
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,792
His name is Wan.

251
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,375
His name is also Wan.

252
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,333
A few more of you
and I'll have a whole week.

253
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,875
I'll give you a new name.

254
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:12,833
Sorn.

255
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,083
From now on, you are Sorn.

256
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,375
Repeat after me, Sorn.

257
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,375
- Sorn.
- Yes.

258
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,833
Since today is your first day, work hard.

259
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,708
You are new to Chiang Mai, aren't you?

260
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,375
Yes.

261
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,833
- How do you know?
- Those green shoes gave it away.

262
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,625
Every soldier who flees the army
has those shoes.

263
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,333
Since it's your first day, work hard.

264
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,833
Kindly ask your customers for tips.
Work hard.

265
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,708
- All right?
- Thank you.

266
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,625
Handsome.

267
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,542
<i>The job felt weird at first,</i>

268
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:05,417
<i>but I got used to it after a while.</i>

269
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:10,917
Guess what I bought

270
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:14,875
after I got my first check.

271
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,375
A motorbike?

272
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,083
No.

273
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,250
A phone?

274
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,500
No.

275
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,208
It was a pair of shoes.

276
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,083
Why?

277
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,333
My friends here teased me

278
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,250
about my old shoes.

279
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,167
Really?

280
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,750
Yes.

281
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:46,500
I have to blend in with Thai people
as much as I can.

282
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,750
When the police see foreigners
with those shoes

283
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,083
and who look out of place,

284
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,042
they often ask to see ID.

285
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:59,042
I'm terrified of the police.
They always extort money.

286
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,958
Policemen are dicks.

287
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,792
<i>The truth is I sneaked in quietly.</i>

288
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,208
<i>I picked the lock.</i>

289
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,667
REVENGE

290
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,250
NEEWAK

291
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,705
STOP ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE

292
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,542
What did he do?

293
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,417
<i>He was a bad man.</i>

294
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,125
<i>He caused social conflict and disharmony.</i>

295
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,042
Stop hurting the people!

296
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,750
<i>He kept blaming the government.</i>

297
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,458
It's tear gas! Run!

298
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:49,292
<i>Nothing would have happened
if he had kept to his duty as a student.</i>

299
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,542
Tyrant bootlickers!

300
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,042
<i>Our country needed peace.</i>

301
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,000
- Fuck you!
- Your salary is our tax payment!

302
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,708
Ji.

303
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,208
Can I go with you after our session ends?

304
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,250
You are usually in a rush to go home.

305
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I only have 400 bahts left on me.

306
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,958
The club will close from tomorrow.

307
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,750
I don't know what I'm going to do.

308
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,125
Sure.

309
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,333
Come with me tonight.

310
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Let's find something exciting to do.

311
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,208
Thank you.

312
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,209
NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECTED
TO ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE

313
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,292
Do you see the guy putting up the posters?

314
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,250
His name is Wuth.

315
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,750
He's 22 years old.

316
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,250
On the outside,
he looks like an ordinary boy.

317
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,208
He was probably out drinking.

318
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,375
He's my next target.

319
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,167
Would you be interested

320
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,042
in a job?

321
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,125
I would.

322
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,417
What kind of job is it?

323
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,250
A guide.

324
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,917
Show me and my friend around
your hometown in Myanmar.

325
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,000
How will you get there?

326
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,583
Isn't the border closed due to COVID-19?

327
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,042
The same way you entered Thailand.

328
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,250
But

329
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:04,292
it's very dangerous.

330
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:09,417
I don't want to go back to my country now.

331
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,792
Are you going to show us
around your hometown or not?

332
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,667
No, sorry.

333
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:39,042
BOOZER KARAOKE

334
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,333
Hey, Sorn.

335
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,583
- See you later.
- See you.

336
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:47,208
No man is trying to take you home tonight.

337
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,792
There weren't any customers.
I didn't get any tips.

338
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,750
It's okay. Things will be better tomorrow.

339
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,042
The bar will be closed from tomorrow.

340
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,417
It's not the end of the world.

341
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,500
Let's go home.

342
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:36,208
Come on. Give me a smile.

343
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,417
Sorn.

344
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,167
Sorn.

345
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,333
Sorn.

346
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,917
Have you paid the rent?

347
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,167
I asked, have you paid the rent?

348
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,375
No.

349
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,042
Where's the money I gave you?

350
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,458
What did you do with it?

351
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,417
I used it to get a passport.

352
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,333
How are we going to live?

353
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,958
I thought I would be able
to make more money if I had a passport

354
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,333
so I borrowed your money.

355
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,792
Where's your passport then?

356
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:04,958
Where's the money?

357
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,708
Things are slow during the pandemic.

358
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:08,792
The club is closed.

359
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,417
Then why did you spend the money?

360
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,518
What was I supposed to do?

361
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:13,042
Why didn't you ask me first?

362
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,250
Hello, Nan.

363
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,583
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,000
Wash your hands first.

365
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,833
You are not wearing a mask.

366
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:30,583
We want to know
the status of our passports.

367
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:35,042
The process started only a few days ago.
They aren't ready yet. Be patient.

368
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,875
Can we have our money back?

369
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,042
I'm sorry, but it's too late for a refund.

370
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,667
Do you know
when our passports will be ready?

371
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,375
Listen, I'm waiting
for your passports too.

372
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:49,542
But you know how the pandemic

373
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,625
is slowing everything down.

374
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:55,250
But the passports aren't here yet.
What are you doing with our money?

375
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:59,750
I didn't force you to give me the money.

376
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:02,458
You walked in here yourselves.
Do you remember?

377
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,875
I remember.

378
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:07,000
But I need the money.
Can you give me back the money?

379
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,875
Help me out, please.

380
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,167
I'm doing the best I can.

381
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,542
Don't you understand
that it's the pandemic?

382
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,917
- We should go.
- I understand.

383
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,201
- Yes, go home.
- Let's go, Sorn.

384
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,601
I'll call you
when the passports are ready.

385
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,875
Don't ask me again.

386
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,375
I have no choice
since I've run out of money.

387
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:23,333
He talks like we are rich or something.

388
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,167
The pandemic
is taking a toll on all of us.

389
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,750
I need two carpenters
and two concrete finishers.

390
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,500
You can go.

391
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,792
It didn't use to be this hot
when we first got here.

392
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,333
We wouldn't have decided

393
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,792
to work at the club if we hadn't thought
labor work was hot and tiring.

394
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,042
Yes, you are right.

395
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,542
I need five workers.

396
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:30,917
Hey.

397
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,792
What type of job
do you think he has for us?

398
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,667
Whatever it is, just do it.

399
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,458
The police are here.

400
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:42,542
Go.

401
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,042
Sorn!

402
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,292
May I see your work permit?

403
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:02,000
What documents do you have?

404
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,833
Do you have a passport?

405
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:12,625
If you don't have any documents,
we will have to lock you up.

406
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,500
But my passport is arriving soon.

407
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,042
I have a number you can call.

408
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,292
No.

409
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,375
Can I talk to your boss then?

410
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,417
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

411
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,458
Hey, lock him up.

412
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:32,750
He's pissing me off.

413
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,333
Please calm down, Lieutenant.

414
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,250
I'll take care of him.

415
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,333
All right.

416
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,458
Ji.

417
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,417
Are you a cop?

418
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,958
What happened to you?
What brought you here today?

419
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,833
I was arrested for having no passport.

420
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:03,625
Really? Hasn't Nan given you the passport?

421
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,917
Do you know Nan?

422
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,042
Do you remember the job I offered you?

423
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:17,250
What do you think now?

424
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,333
Have you changed your mind?

425
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,917
What are you talking about?

426
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,125
I want you to be my guide

427
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,167
and take me and my friend to your hometown

428
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,542
in Myanmar.

429
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,333
I don't know why
you don't want to go back home.

430
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,917
But if you don't want to go to jail,

431
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,625
you will have to help me.

432
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:59,083
Will I be able to come back to Thailand

433
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,792
if I cross the border?

434
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,292
This is just a partial payment.

435
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:30,167
Once you finish the job,

436
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,542
I will pay you money too.

437
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:39,917
But you have to promise me first

438
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,333
that you will help me.

439
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,375
I've checked the VPN. It's secured.

440
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,208
They won't be able to trace us.

441
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,667
Bitch, I know it's dangerous,
but I have to retrieve the hard disk.

442
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:09,125
I'll recheck everything again
before I leak it tomorrow.

443
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,083
Have you prepared

444
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,625
an escape route for me?

445
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,333
They aren't joking around this time.

446
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,125
See you soon.

447
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:22,917
Bye.

448
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:29,625
I have a gun. Don't make a noise.
Don't resist. Just follow me.

449
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,917
Calm down, boy. Calm down.

450
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,958
You are Wuth, right?

451
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,042
Why are you so concerned
about human trafficking?

452
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,292
Why are you risking your life over it?

453
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:22,542
Do you know who you are messing with?

454
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,750
I have every reason to.

455
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,708
Put yourself in my shoes.

456
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,583
You would do the same thing as me

457
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,708
if you were in my position.

458
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,708
Have you thought of it that way?

459
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:59,042
Do you really think
you can change the system?

460
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,333
It's better than doing nothing.

461
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,542
Honestly,

462
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,542
I wouldn't be sitting here

463
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,417
if Bhoom was still alive.

464
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:17,917
Is it worth it?

465
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,667
I might kill you today.

466
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,875
Do you think it will be over?

467
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,542
When I go missing,

468
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,042
someone else will come out
and fight for me.

469
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,083
Just like how I'm fighting for Bhoom.

470
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,625
I'm wondering

471
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:49,208
if it was your parents, your kid,

472
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:50,708
or your wife

473
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:52,083
sitting here, not me,

474
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,958
would you treat them
the way you are treating me now?

475
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,500
You murderer.

476
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,333
<i>Breakfast is ready, Bhoom.</i>

477
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:08,958
Eat your breakfast first.

478
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:12,958
Wuth, look at this.

479
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:15,000
Eaun sent this to me.

480
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,708
The documents say

481
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:22,125
that high-ranking officials and executives
are involved in human trafficking.

482
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,167
What's your plan?

483
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:45,667
I'm going to expose them.

484
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,625
I'll be right back.

485
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:57,875
Bhoom.

486
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,750
Why don't you eat first?

487
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,708
I'll be back to eat soon.

488
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:07,542
See you later.

489
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,875
What are you going to do next?

490
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,208
We just have to get Wuth ordained
at the temple you ordained at.

491
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:55,667
And everything will be over.

492
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:09,875
Are you going to kill him?

493
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:16,083
I'm supposed to get rid of Wuth

494
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,083
like I did Bhoom.

495
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:21,208
But I'm not going to kill him.

496
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,333
I've committed enough sin.

497
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,250
Why did you do it the first time then?

498
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,917
Back then, I had no choice.

499
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:43,750
But I have a choice now.

500
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:46,792
Because I have you.

501
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,708
What about me? Do I have a choice?

502
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,292
What's wrong?

503
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:25,292
A checkpoint. There's a checkpoint ahead.

504
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:39,583
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

505
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,292
Please untie me.

506
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,042
Let's run away together.

507
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,542
Let's run away, Sorn.

508
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:17,583
STOP THE CAR

509
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:18,667
Let them pass.

510
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,750
I need a backup!

511
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:44,708
Let's split up.

512
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,917
Hey, where are you going?

513
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,250
I can't trust you.

514
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,417
But thank you.

515
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,667
Don't run away again.

516
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,792
You will be home soon, Sorn.

517
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:53,542
Are you happy?

518
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,875
I don't want to go home.

519
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,333
We will arrive soon, Wuth.

520
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,083
Shut the fuck up.

521
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:24,625
I heard everything.

522
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,167
You killed Bhoom.

523
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,250
You are a murderer.

524
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:34,583
I'm supposed to kill you too.
You know that, right?

525
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,958
I'm risking my life to save yours.

526
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,250
You will be dead
if I don't bring you across the border.

527
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:49,167
And it won't just be you.

528
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:53,042
Your parents, siblings, and friends
will die too.

529
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,125
I'm helping you right now.

530
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,417
You aren't doing shit.

531
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,833
It doesn't matter if I die or not,

532
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:08,125
but people shouldn't be erased
for trying to say the truth.

533
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:03,458
How far?

534
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,125
It's a short walk from here.

535
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,500
Can I take a break?

536
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,167
What?

537
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,000
Can I take a break?

538
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,167
Sure. Sorn, let's take a break here.

539
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,417
It'll be easier to walk around.

540
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,292
Who are you? Hands up.

541
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,958
Ji, Wuth, put your hands up.

542
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:21,333
Yoon?

543
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,542
Wan?

544
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,958
Tie them up.

545
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:31,958
- Come here.
- Come.

546
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,750
You are Wan, aren't you?

547
01:01:58,042 --> 01:02:00,500
Why the fuck did you come back?

548
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,458
Why?

549
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:10,958
Is it so bad to be a soldier?

550
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:12,917
Is it?

551
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,125
Say something.

552
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:26,333
You, son of a bitch.

553
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:27,833
You, coward.

554
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,208
You ran away,

555
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,333
leaving your family
to fight for your nation.

556
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:40,958
We've never won against Myanmar

557
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:43,667
because of people like you.

558
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:50,125
Everyone, lock him up in prison.

559
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,208
Yes, sir.

560
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,375
Yoon.

561
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:30,875
I'm your friend.

562
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,542
I'm your friend.

563
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,125
Yoon, are you going to leave me here?

564
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:05,333
Why the fuck
did you come back then, idiot?

565
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,333
You don't want to kill me.

566
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,292
You want me to survive.

567
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,000
You want to torture me

568
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:22,667
by making me live in hiding.

569
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,792
So you can feel better about yourself
for not killing me.

570
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,708
But it's too late to right your wrongs.

571
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,833
You've killed someone.

572
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:49,250
He's not coming back.

573
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:43,542
Just follow your boss's order.

574
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:53,958
Finish me off.

575
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,250
Don't you realize at all

576
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,375
that I brought you all the way here

577
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,375
and I'm sparing your life

578
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:09,917
because I want to quit?

579
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:16,542
You want to quit?

580
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:23,375
Do you see now
how fucked up the system is?

581
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,458
Fucker, soon enough,

582
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:32,417
the system will collapse
and crush everyone under it,

583
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,042
including yourself.

584
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,542
Someone's coming. Hide.

585
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,125
Stay here.

586
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,917
What are they trying to do?

587
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,583
I told them to go back to Thailand.
Why are they still here?

588
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,250
They don't want to return to Thailand.

589
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:13,042
They came here to take
that man to the temple.

590
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:14,875
I see.

591
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:16,917
Let's take a break.

592
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,208
What's the plan?

593
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:29,167
Ji, what's the plan?

594
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,542
I'm leaving Wuth with you.

595
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,667
You have to take Wuth to the temple.

596
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,458
As for me,

597
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:47,292
I have to return to Thailand.

598
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:50,792
If they can't contact me
when the sun rises,

599
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:52,833
we will all be in trouble.

600
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,208
If I bring you back to Thailand,

601
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:13,875
I will have to kill you.

602
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:19,042
I have no choice.

603
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,458
Please stay here.

604
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,500
It's for your own good.

605
01:09:34,792 --> 01:09:37,250
All your belongings are in this bag.

606
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Wan.

607
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,375
Can you do me a favor?

608
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,625
What is it?

609
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,167
Can you tell him to shoot me
in the shoulder?

610
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:20,667
Ji, he asks you
to shoot him in the shoulder.

611
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,667
Let's use my gun.
It will be more believable.

612
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,875
Cover your ears.

613
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,417
Are we almost there yet?

614
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,792
Just keep walking.
We'll get there eventually.

615
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:01,333
What does that mean?

616
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,750
It means stop complaining
and keep walking.

617
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,625
Hurry up.

618
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:27,958
Come on.

619
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,375
Come on, let's take a swim.

620
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,833
Just strip naked.

621
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:35,625
Come on.

622
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,625
Wait a second.

623
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,208
It's cold.

624
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:04,792
Stop.

625
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:06,417
Hey.

626
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,375
Stop.

627
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,083
I wonder if I'll miss home.

628
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,375
I might miss Thailand like crazy.

629
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:38,292
I thought you hated Thailand.

630
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,625
How can I hate my home country?

631
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,667
I love my home country.

632
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,375
I want to make it better.

633
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:58,875
I want to live a good life

634
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,667
with the person I love.

635
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:17,292
I don't even know where to call home.

636
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,583
It's okay.

637
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,917
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

638
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,125
Do I have to hold it tightly?

639
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,333
- Yes.
- Okay.

640
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:16,042
- Next, you twist it with your right hand.
- Next…

641
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,125
Like this?

642
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,125
Hold it. Pull it tight.

643
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,000
- Twist it like this?
- Yes.

644
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,583
I have to hold it high.

645
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:24,375
- Not too high.
- Okay.

646
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,083
- Like this?
- Yes.

647
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:32,500
- After that…
- I take my arm out like this, right?

648
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,792
- Yes.
- Now what?

649
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,167
Then place it on your shoulder.

650
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:50,542
Don't I look pretty, Mrs. Sorn?

651
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:05,375
My mind might run even wilder here.

652
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,833
You'll get used to it soon.

653
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,375
Think of this temple

654
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,875
as another home of yours.

655
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,000
Yes.

656
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:23,542
I guess I'll do that.

657
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:48,083
This is yours.

658
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,167
Ji left it for you.

659
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:16,083
Use it to return to Thailand.

660
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:27,000
Bee, why the long face?

661
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:33,042
Have you not found Sorn yet?

662
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,375
No.

663
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:39,583
Why don't you report him missing?

664
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:44,458
There's no point
reporting a missing alien.

665
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,375
Nobody will give a darn.

666
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:51,792
They will extort him for money.

667
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:54,375
He doesn't have any documents.

668
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:56,625
Poor guy.

669
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:59,167
I feel sorry for him.

670
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:03,542
Stay with Daddy Meng for the time being.

671
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,750
I heard he's a sugar daddy.

672
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,375
Hey.

673
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:16,333
He's offering to give you so many things,

674
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:18,625
a condo and a car.

675
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:21,792
Just accept them.
Don't think about it too much.

676
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:23,625
The pandemic isn't over yet.

677
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,833
Use those assets to start a life
with your boyfriend.

678
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:38,417
This bitch.

679
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,208
Put a smile on your face.
You are paid to be here.

680
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,208
Here I come.

681
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:04,417
- Where were you?
- I'm here. That's enough.

682
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,375
You are late to the party.

683
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:10,625
After this glass, someone's taking a dip.

684
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:35,625
- Hello.
- Hello.

685
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:37,875
- How much?
- It's 1,500 bahts.

686
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,792
Come on, the economy is bad.

687
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:42,667
How about 1,200 bahts?

688
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,583
I will pay 1,000 bahts.

689
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:48,625
Deal.

690
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:51,542
What will you do for 1,000 bahts?

691
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:53,542
It's up to you. I'll do anything.

692
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:56,250
Get in.

693
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:39,375
It's hard being poor.

694
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:42,458
Not really.

695
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,625
Whatever, Mr. Billionaire.

696
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:54,333
What does a luxurious life sound like?

697
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,167
Well…

698
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:59,792
Once I win the lottery,

699
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,292
we will run away together,

700
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:05,708
stay in a fancy hotel, and stuff ourselves

701
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:07,250
<i>to death with seafood.</i>

702
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,333
<i>How does that sound?</i>

703
01:28:20,042 --> 01:28:21,542
How much are you paying me?

704
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:50,917
Som.

705
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:53,875
Inspector.

706
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,750
Have you heard from Ji?

707
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:57,583
No.

708
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:01,417
But I've sent every man looking for him.

709
01:29:03,042 --> 01:29:04,875
You didn't need to come all the way here.

710
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:17,958
It could be you!

711
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:19,402
- It could be you!
- It could be you!

712
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:21,125
It could be you!

713
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,875
- It could be you!
- It could be you!

714
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:24,667
No one should be forced…

715
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,833
- To go missing!
- To go missing!

716
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:28,583
It could be you!

717
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:30,458
- It could be you!
- It could be you!

718
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,708
It could be you!

719
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:34,101
- It could be you!
- It could be you!

720
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:35,792
No one should be forced…

721
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,958
- To go missing!
- To go missing!

722
01:29:38,042 --> 01:29:39,417
It could be you!

723
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,792
- It could be you!
- It could be you!

724
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:43,917
No one

725
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,042
should be forced

726
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:46,167
to go missing.

727
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,042
It could be you!

728
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,042
…should be forced to go missing.

729
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:26,375
