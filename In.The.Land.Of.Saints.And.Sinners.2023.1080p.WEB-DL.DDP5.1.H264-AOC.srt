1
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,530
Here they come.

2
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,380
Let's go now boys.

3
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm fucking kids.

4
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,900
Don't bother it, I'm Patrick.

5
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
Oh, that's all we need.

6
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,140
That's it!

7
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm just leaving!

8
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,980
Fuckin' move it!

9
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,500
You're a Demi-as-out-shout-fen-bar.

10
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
You over there?

11
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,880
I can see what you're up to, right?

12
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,176
How can I bloody blast them
if I can't freakin' see them?

13
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,080
Move them back up to
the top of the roof there.

14
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
The wind, I can't hear.

15
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,420
All right, sure.

16
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,880
If you're implying that I'm
cheating, guard O'Shea.

17
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I'll take it very thick.

18
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,271
Well, there's a wager. It has to be fair.

19
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,696
Are you gonna winch about fairness all day?

20
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,561
Or are you gonna take your shot and lose?

21
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,940
Like you always do.

22
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,280
Hope you're whole.

23
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,580
Come on with ya.

24
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,551
Seat for a little bastard.

25
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Thank you.

26
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,200
Robin, me blind, you whore.

27
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,931
So what is the day, promise?

28
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,230
Apart from feeding
your cat and pondering

29
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,610
human reason with
Gulliver and the little folk?

30
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,451
I've finished Gulliver's troubles.

31
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,970
I'm on to Mr. Dostoyevsky now.

32
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,310
Rush some rider.

33
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,990
He is the no-nothing of him.

34
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,761
I think Christie's gonna make a cup of tea.

35
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,470
Where are we going?

36
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,721
No, I'm a bit of a visual business.

37
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,790
Mrs. Bailey come up to
me and said the welcome

38
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,070
saying to the town this
way has gone missed.

39
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,210
No, you'll see what real work entails.

40
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,831
God, that's the best of a mess.

41
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,530
Maroon.

42
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,090
Burgundy.

43
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,490
Burgundy.

44
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,950
Burgundy.

45
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,510
It's not a bad car back.

46
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,501
The agent must have
lost control of the car.

47
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,990
Or drunk.

48
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,130
Hi.

49
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,541
Probably thick in the head.

50
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,150
See, you'll be looking for
some metal case in town now.

51
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,150
Hi.

52
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,310
Shouldn't need them but tea time, so...

53
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,240
I can feel your eyes
on the back of my head.

54
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Read up.

55
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,390
I have no doubt.

56
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,980
Adam would have traded his Eve for you.

57
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Have you saw this place?

58
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,720
Well, it's best to have a Holly.

59
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,020
Oh, a little bright in a bomb.

60
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
With a table of seven.

61
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,460
Would you would know if you'd ever
accepted my invitation to dinner? I saw.

62
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,160


63
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
I was Brandon holding up.

64
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,181
He's far too worse to be getting better.

65
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,431
So would the Feignon woman like herself?

66
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,411
There's one he won't be hanging around.

67
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,860
Loaden left six dead,
including three children.

68
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,360
The IRA is believed to
be behind the bombing,

69
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,676
though they have yet
to claim responsibility.

70
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,600
Anyone with information about the
attack is encouraged to come forward.

71
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,440
Alright, waiting down.

72
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,980
I can't see enough
without this next person.

73
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,790
It's done more for this
town than we deserve.

74
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,260
A man of many talents, in fact,

75
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,860
with a little encouragement
perhaps he'd treat us here tonight.

76
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Bart McGinnis.

77
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,050
Would you honor us
with a song? Oh, no.

78
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,400
You can't talk.

79
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,640


80
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,440
What do you know? Let me see.

81
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,120


82
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Give me your attention.

83
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Can we have enough?

84
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,020
I wish I was in Carrick Fergus.

85
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,440
Only for nights in Ballygran.

86
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,160
I would swim off her.

87
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,700
The deepest ocean.

88
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,010
You're not just shooting me here.

89
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,960
This day I was both this exercise.

90
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,320
Keep water right on the left.

91
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Here I'll be fine.

92
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,200
Two steps to your right.

93
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Start digging.

94
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,170
Where are we?

95
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,640
We're going to spend eternity here.

96
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
Nice to know what I am.

97
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
Donnie Gore.

98
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
You're in Donnie Gore, the
other round of the country.

99
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,060
The Forgotten County seems fitting.

100
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,930
And this is how you earn a living.

101
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,020
She's deep enough.

102
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
How'd you get? On your knees.

103
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Jesus.

104
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
On these trees.

105
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,340


106
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
You've been busy? On your knees.

107
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860


108
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,660
Now it's behind the old head there.

109
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
You have one minute.

110
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Say what you will.

111
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Play it if you want.

112
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Makes no odds.

113
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,910
No pleading necessary.

114
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,860
I knew this day was coming.

115
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,340
Mind you, it took longer than I thought.

116
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,040
It was a lifetime ago.

117
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,850
But a fierce temper is a lad.

118
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,710
Did my share a killing?

119
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:41,130
I knew that there was no
going back to what I'd done.

120
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,210
But one day I decided that
whatever was left of my withering soul.

121
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,270
shouldn't be wasted, so.

122
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,690
Somehow I blew that black cloud away.

123
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,970
Became part of the community.

124
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,910
Did what I could for those around me.

125
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,590
You know, this is where it ends.

126
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,690
For people like us.

127
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,290
In some windswept bucket patch.

128
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,170
Train to some good before
you find yourself here.

129
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,070
If only so much time.

130
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:38,310
Ah, but my days are numbered.

131
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,590
Come all you young men and lay me down.

132
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,000
Many a deer has to fall.

133
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,940
So are the hiccups and kev.

134
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
You're queer, Robert.

135
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,560
Your music suggests you're queer.

136
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,320
You slow kev.

137
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:08,960
Your boots suggest you're slow.

138
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,590
Got a magic muck in the
mess you left out there.

139
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,820
That's a brilliant moody blues, 45.

140
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,110
I'm gonna borrow this one.

141
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,100
And dojans draws the
weak to an early grave.

142
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Who's that? Yeah, it's.

143
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
..

144
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
It's my mother.

145
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Who's that?

146
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Only me and Mrs. McKee.

147
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,120
Oh, the mower, are you?

148
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Robbie said you were coming in.

149
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,020
So I'd made your favorite scones for you.

150
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,290
Oh, Terry, huh? Reason.

151
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,360
I thought it was raised.

152
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:02,780
I couldn't stop.

153
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,500
Well, it is.

154
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,240
You know me better than I know myself.

155
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,620
I thought so.

156
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
I thought so.

157
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,180
You'll take them with you then.

158
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,520
I will.

159
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,500
You've never not taken them.

160
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,580
Ah, good food and mornin' ya, buttes.

161
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
That was hot.

162
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,600
Hey, hey, hey, manners.

163
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,580
There it is.

164
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,520
The fastest hand in the West.

165
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,040
No, that was a Dublin mile.

166
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,420
Kiss and kiss.

167
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Oh, God.

168
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Here we are.

169
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Oh, yourself.

170
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Hey.

171
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,380
Oh, you auditioned.

172
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Mm-hmm.

173
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,530
It took it as payment
from the O'Reilly clan.

174
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,400
Some Mexican fella painted it.

175
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,460
Quite en vogue in America, apparently.

176
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,900
Worth a lot more than I was old.

177
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,060
Too bad you can't sell a
back to us right from home.

178
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:04,320
Oh, uh, he than I had.

179
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,620
I'd have something else
for you in a week or so.

180
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,530
Yeah, it's the end.

181
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,090
Good job.

182
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,950
Give it to him.

183
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,010
All of them.

184
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,620
Been thinking quite a bit lately.

185
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,180
Been a lifetime of pure choices of me and
Robert Jefferson's Margaret died, you know.

186
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,220
I mean, there's more to me than this.

187
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
I'd like folks to see it.

188
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,220
Oh, and, uh, what is it you're
so anxious to show the world?

189
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,180
This is all you know.

190
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,210
I could plant a garden.

191
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,170
A garden.

192
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,510
All right.

193
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,200
So, you're just going to jail me?

194
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,050
Well, leave me with that gone bean.

195
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,250
You're going to miss me.

196
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,830
Like an old man.

197
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,000
What seeds do you
want? I have seeds.

198
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660


199
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,440
They're not ones for buying seeds, so do I.

200
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,780
No, not before.

201
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,090
Are you sure about seeds?

202
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
At least, have you
caught any or not? All right.

203
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520


204
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
We have, uh,

205
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,980
Broad beans, cabbage, some of carrots,

206
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,300
and there's really
other stuff there to eat.

207
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,150
So, I was thinking I could
start a garden in my own.

208
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
A bit of popple.

209
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,710
Maybe some goldenrod.

210
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,780
Like that yellow wave
you've got going out there.

211
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,160
Goldenrod is a weed, Finbar.

212
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Didn't know that.

213
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,360
Might need a teacher, so.

214
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Is it okay?

215
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,576
I don't know what I'm enjoying more.

216
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
The food or the company.

217
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,920
Was your way for good cook?

218
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Margaret, was it?

219
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:21,620
Often where I'm sorry.

220
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,040
I didn't.

221
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,620
No, no, no.

222
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,140
You're fine.

223
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
You're fine.

224
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,500
It's just been so long since
I've heard her name spoken.

225
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Margaret.

226
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Oh, she's experimenting.

227
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
She baked this break.

228
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,540
It's just a long time ago.

229
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,180
Put apples and nuts into the mix.

230
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,580
We bit a cinnamon thrown in there.

231
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,620
Never tasted the leg of it.

232
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:47,621
Oh, it's not gorgeous.

233
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,660
Jesus, no, it was awful.

234
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
It's like I said.

235
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,020
I never tasted the leg of it.

236
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
And thankfully, I never did again.

237
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Was this in Dublin?

238
00:23:59,520 --> 00:23:59,720
Hi.

239
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
Sure.

240
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,940
Past the bookshop where
she worked every day.

241
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,680
Welcome to the factory, you know.

242
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
God, she loved those books.

243
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
It got me hooked.

244
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,260
I wish it could have mattered.

245
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,700
Well, it was too good for me now, woman.

246
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
It's him as yourself.

247
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,820
I'll just be with none.

248
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Hmm.

249
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,830
How's it going?

250
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,098
If you hook a rod, be
careful because that line

251
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,970
could cut into the palm
of your hand, darling.

252
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,230
Here.

253
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,890
Come on, use that.

254
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,510
There you go.

255
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:52,511
Good girl.

256
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,010
What are you hoping
to catch? The goldfish.

257
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,310
Take him home.

258
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,890
Call him Goldie.

259
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,060
A fish wouldn't care for you.

260
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,500
And my dad, Daddy, is
to say that you shouldn't

261
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:09,090
care for those that
don't care for you.

262
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,830
It didn't fair enough.

263
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,030
I was told to get a fish for dinner.

264
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
You're on.

265
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,280
That's some lay note.

266
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
That's some lay note.

267
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,790
Oh, yeah.

268
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,350
It's okay.

269
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,910
Oh, yeah.

270
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, yeah.

271
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,001
Oh, yeah.

272
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Where did you snare? Finnbar.

273
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820


274
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,110
It's price to see you in person like this.

275
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,780
Kevin.

276
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Finnbar.

277
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
He's grumpy tonight.

278
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,080
Oh, they'll bastard.

279
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,120
Never in your life.

280
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,560
Hi.

281
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,350
And this is my one night out.

282
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,882
I've made a plane for
the grumpy bollocks who

283
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,280
need a baby sound for
his long suffering wife.

284
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,420
I have a wee black bush, please.

285
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,580
Flash in the cache.

286
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:28,220
I've driven books ever and
you're living on every note.

287
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,980
As long as I keep winning
money of you, I'll do you just think.

288
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,280
Any luck cuts in your evil, Knievel boy?

289
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,700
Ah, not a bit of it.

290
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,380
Now, it hasn't been most food
for the days, I have to admit.

291
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,600
But I'll get him.

292
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
I'm sure you are.

293
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Hey, what's up, please?

294
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,380
I'm in Finland there, son.

295
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Thank you, my friend.

296
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
That's an old tune.

297
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,000
Old as the hills, but
it always has a place.

298
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
You stay that here?

299
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Old as the hills?

300
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
We call it a jig.

301
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Of course.

302
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,240
Thank you.

303
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,480
So what brought you over here?

304
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,218
Long ago, an Irish
man came to my village,

305
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,180
playing the most beautiful
song I'd ever heard.

306
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,360
He left before I could lend
it, so I just had to come.

307
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Do you not miss it?

308
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
No.

309
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,680
I do not miss the fighters.

310
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,990
I do not miss the broad.

311
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,320
So you're loyal, but the
bridge is efficient for dinner.

312
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,680
Sounds like my way and all right.

313
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
She's our own woman.

314
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,840
We're like ships passing in the night.

315
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,740
We're working here all
the hours, good sense.

316
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,340
Don't be giving her too much grief.

317
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
What's that?

318
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,520
The box I grew up, but
tumbled into the river.

319
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,060
What?

320
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,240
That was not me.

321
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,920
I was the apanant distract in her.

322
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,340
Great.

323
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,180
Well, thanks for the hands up.

324
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Let's be the answers.

325
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
I'll talk to you soon.

326
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,680
Where are you after?

327
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,930
Surely you're not fleeing
over the spilled food.

328
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
Oh, yeah.

329
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,100
That told you her marvellous
one, what are you doing?

330
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,570
She's going to miss you something shocking.

331
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
Stuck out here alone.

332
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,070
and you off right in the plains.

333
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
You're brave and loyal.

334
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,210
I've seen those horses hit the dark.

335
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,060
Scared stuff of the rabbit
holes and the rabbits.

336
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,760
Best to run away during the day.

337
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,650
So you don't, you know, run
into anything when I expect it.

338
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
What's up to you, I
suppose, the other boss.

339
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Do, do, do.

340
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,350
You're now still on the caravan.

341
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,660
Hi, my mom says we're
gonna go and never be done.

342
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
You can go now.

343
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,380
What? You can go now.

344
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940


345
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,380
No, no, a gentleman always
leaves the lady to the door.

346
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
I said I'm fine.

347
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
What the fuck?

348
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Where's he been?

349
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
The fucking star in here.

350
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Who's this? A gentleman.

351
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,180
Oh.

352
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:10,076
It's just like your real uncle Curtis said.

353
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
You're not my uncle.

354
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,950
Here you watch her back talk.

355
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Do you hear me?

356
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
Women, eh?

357
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Fuckin' nightmares.

358
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,410
Oh, if that isn't a wonder,
I'll buy it from Mr. Traveler.

359
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,850
I can straight away, just when we get in.

360
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,810
What the fuck is this?

361
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,250
Apples?

362
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,606
I don't know if this is how to get in here.

363
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,366
You've been gone for two hours
and you come back to be apples.

364
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,786
Is there something fucking wrong with you?

365
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,810
Hey!

366
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:12,750
What the fuck up?

367
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,850
What the fuck is this easy to her brother?

368
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,650
He's don't even sound the same.

369
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,390
He's don't even business.

370
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,990
What are you doing all this time?

371
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,950
I've just been waiting down to Caravan.

372
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,190
I don't even need to be
hanging around down there.

373
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,510
You just get what we
need and you come back.

374
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,570
Don't you understand?

375
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,070
Where's Mark? Oh, Jesus.

376
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940


377
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,410
I mean, thank you.

378
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,110
Why is this heavy?

379
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,766
Will you take a cup of tea?

380
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,850
No, no, thanks, girl.

381
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,810
Is Mark up?

382
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
What have you got there?

383
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Not got anything.

384
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,070
Maybe I said I was your mother.

385
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,290
No, please.

386
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,100
Don't say anything to her.

387
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Show me.

388
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,350
Come on, show me.

389
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,060
Put it togethers.

390
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,300
Did your uncle give you this?

391
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
He's not my uncle.

392
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,820
Why did he give this to you, man?

393
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,896
There's a good something to do with these.

394
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
These bruises on you.

395
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Oh, yeah.

396
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,220
Let something happen.

397
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,250
You don't want me to tell me about it.

398
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
You're a blast.

399
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,340
So the gentleman caller returns.

400
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Morning, Sinead.

401
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Morning, my eh.

402
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:32,456
Hope you're not thinking about
making a move in our Sinead.

403
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,040
She's a wee bit young for you, I'd say.

404
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Shut your hole, Curtis.

405
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,140
Do you mind him for him, Barry?

406
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
He's an arsehole.

407
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,890
Well, I can't even have a
wee bit of chitchat with locals.

408
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
Me and him are sweet.

409
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,420
And they're out there, man.

410
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Ah, here we go.

411
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,056
Nothing like a wee bit of skinny
div in the work of an appetite.

412
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Just take it and go.

413
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,040
I'll bring you more tonight after work.

414
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
I'm going off my fucking number.

415
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,900
Can't blame me for wanting
a wee bit of a new company.

416
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Fuck you.

417
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,120
Catch you later, Princess.

418
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Old friend.

419
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,431
You can pick your friends.

420
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,071
You don't get to choose
your bloody and lost.

421
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I, um...

422
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,140
My brother married his sister.

423
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,581
And promptly got himself killed.

424
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,911
I can't wait to see the back of him.

425
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,051
I thought you were all for
leaving this business behind.

426
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:46,866
Give it to that wee bollocks, Kevin.

427
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,270
I'd pay.

428
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,350
Are you wise?

429
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,050
A local fella?

430
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,941
You want the boys and blue at your door?

431
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,660
This clan isn't from here.

432
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,850
He's a blue one.

433
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,911
But the name of
Curtis... I don't care.

434
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,470
Not on our doorstep.

435
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,330
Besides, it could be IRA.

436
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,656
Now, look, stay in the way from
them fellows to the rest of your life.

437
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,281
So, we just let him keep on hurting her.

438
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,806
You don't even know what he's done.

439
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,830
I know.

440
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,990
I could see it in her eyes.

441
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,691
And that's his message
for her to keep quiet.

442
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,610
Jesus, he's a child, Robert.

443
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,830
Shop him to the guards.

444
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,890
An anonymous tip off.

445
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,970
Mm, consciously.

446
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,641
You'll never tell him what he's done.

447
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,370
He's put the fear of God on her.

448
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:27,830
And he'll never stop.

449
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,891
He'll just go on to men and others.

450
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,251
Robert, I know what I said about killing.

451
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,570
But this is different.

452
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,030
I want no part of it, Finbar.

453
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,530
Count me out.

454
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,460
Taking your bros for a walk.

455
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,301
So, you actually can't talk, huh?

456
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,251
Only when I'm done listening.

457
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,860
Have some bice and eads hop in.

458
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
I'll give you a lift.

459
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Bye.

460
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,220
So, you're an holiday,
eh? Aye, holiday.

461
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Fuck up.

462
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060


463
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,851
Putting it off in New York, it
fixed my farmer's time, but nah.

464
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,761
That's all squat in the bag, ours
are bleeding fucking nowhere.

465
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,336
Listen, there's cigarettes
in the front there, help or so.

466
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,520
The matches are on the floor.

467
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,301
The funny road never looks
the same on the way back.

468
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,441
That's because giants made these hills.

469
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,510
Aye, is that right?

470
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,030
This land was once ruled by famoreans.

471
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,530
God like seafarers, they were.

472
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,410
Slaved the land at the
children, so the story goes.

473
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,431
Now, to think I just
used them for shooting.

474
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,190
You're under?

475
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,130
Well, if you call shooting bean
cans in the old Jack Rabbit hunt,

476
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,710
then yes, I'm a stupendous hunter.

477
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,750
What do you use? A Smith door.

478
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,310
He hates fucks.

479
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,930


480
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,610
Teddy Roosevelt called it
the finest gun never made.

481
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,230
Whoo.

482
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,610
You wanna see it?

483
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,150
I had a Remington 17 model
before I got this little baby.

484
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,050
Wasn't as nifty.

485
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,110
Didn't have the same.

486
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,530
Bossy qualities.

487
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,470
Beautiful, isn't he?

488
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,270
You want a holder?

489
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,990
We Moya, you bastard.

490
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,490
She's fucking right.

491
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,070
I'll leave.

492
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,590
You'll never fucking see me again.

493
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,740
You're fucking dead.

494
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,690
You're poverty.

495
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,500
So ginger, Jesse Owens, he was.

496
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,800
We did have a knife.

497
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,951
Is that something only young men's carry?

498
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,460
Wouldn't consider me self-intune
what modern you to be fair.

499
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,100
What are you doing out here?

500
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,461
Robert asked me to check up on you.

501
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580
I did, Teddy.

502
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,440
Yeah.

503
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Well, I'm not a kiss.

504
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,600
I like bingo.

505
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,536
Royce has a session on tonight.

506
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
You'll pay for me books.

507
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,481
That cheeky point that too, well.

508
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,840
Oh, what the hell are you
and almost? I'll get down.

509
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Get down.

510
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Christ.

511
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760


512
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,241
I don't understand why they range so much.

513
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
This Yahoo one time.

514
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,710
Taking away so he was.

515
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
What he knew?

516
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,540
That when he stopped, I was there.

517
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah?

518
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
End of the line.

519
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,430
So he just didn't stop.

520
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,431
What should be something like
nine feet when he was done with it?

521
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,620
Oh, please, there's the size of plumes.

522
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,760
Who knows?

523
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,860
He could have taken Fiji or someplace.

524
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,440
I just stood in love.

525
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
There was something else.

526
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,040
It's all a big joke to you, isn't it?

527
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
That's a line of work.

528
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Oh, well.

529
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,360
As my dad always used to say.

530
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Do a job, you love.

531
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,980
And the next one up is stuck in a tree, 53.

532
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Can you go, Fender?

533
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
I'm here for yesterday.

534
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
I forgot sex.

535
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,720
Yeah, there's no need.

536
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,260
Yeah, love.

537
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
My one.

538
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
My two-inch part, Kevin.

539
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,550
She's a foisty one.

540
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,101
Wines me on her left in
the forest no longer, though.

541
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
For more 34.

542
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,340
A woman? Yeah.

543
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920


544
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,760
I'm collected in the
fellas, don't you think?

545
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,940
Mark Dignity before a dime.

546
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
You never?

547
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
No.

548
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,651
There's enough cruel man in this world.

549
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
She was cruel, already.

550
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
For real and looking.

551
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,200
66.

552
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,171
I would be crying to the edge of her.

553
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,440
We've been messed up
in the head, aren't you?

554
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
This is the one.

555
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,401
It's just a bit of money in
me pocket when I need it.

556
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,881
But a body can't look like yours.

557
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Now that's like cutting.

558
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,210
You listen to me, shit.

559
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,500
Killing has no juke and matter to me.

560
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,161
And I'm done with it for good.

561
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:40,360
But if I ever hear of you having a
laugh at someone else's day in tears,

562
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,160
I'll beat you with my own long hands.

563
00:42:57,505 --> 00:42:59,666
You know, many people,
have you killed a lot together?

564
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,471
Who runs my thing off in there?

565
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,761
You know, the day they murdered her father,

566
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,990
Curtis has played
football in the under-twins.

567
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:18,866
Little bollocks wasn't half bad.

568
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,231
I never forget picking him
up, telling him what happened.

569
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,110
He just sat there, just looking at me.

570
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,921
He couldn't make sense of it.

571
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,070
Him growing up bad first
to me, down south to a man.

572
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,491
His whole world turned upside down.

573
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,490
And I made him a promise.

574
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,111
I said I'd always look out for him.

575
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,051
Conan says we should clear it.

576
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,491
And it tracks the fronts somewhere.

577
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,550
How about my brother?

578
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,630
He probably just had a lock and...

579
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,391
drinking, you know what he's like.

580
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,030
And as he developed
the power of invisibility,

581
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,270
a course he didn't spend
the night in a fucking lock-in.

582
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
Think a fucking pig?

583
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,161
We're not going anywhere without Curtis.

584
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,971
He's fucking left, is there?

585
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:14,530
He's probably away on home.

586
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,750
No, he's dead if he goes back. We all are.

587
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,930
Yeah, I know.

588
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,530
Curtis, June, and Duren,

589
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,750
you're the reason we're in this mess.

590
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,670
I knew you would fuck it up.

591
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,050
But we got the bastards, didn't we?
That's what matters.

592
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,086
And what about the kids?
What would they just clatter?

593
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,391
You know fucking rightly, I
couldn't have predicted that.

594
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,670
You made yourself known.

595
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,450
Me and Sheamus, we were in the clear.

596
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,416
They only saw the back of
her head running on a road.

597
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,961
I saw the back of her head last night.

598
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,050
Fuck!

599
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,310
Fuck!

600
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,131
The morning he's in the tensions.

601
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,930
Where are you going?

602
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,550
I'm going out to find the sad bastard,

603
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,790
whose only job was to lay low.

604
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,850
Of course he's doing
that only too fucking well.

605
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,730
If you can't swim and leave that's grand.

606
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,710
Just don't be expected big fucking hogs

607
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,971
when you get back to Belfast.

608
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,040
Curtis! Hey, Sister.

609
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420


610
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,760
What are you doing out of the bungalow?

611
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,680
Yesterday, did Curtis say
where he was heading?

612
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,021
I didn't say me yesterday.

613
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,760
That's always messing.

614
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,591
I should never have
let you back in my life.

615
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,141
Go on, pack your shit, I want you's gone.

616
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,560
Don't you dare speak to me like that.

617
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,820
I'll fucking rip that
tongue from your throat.

618
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,280
Maybe the payer's got him.

619
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,861
They're probably closing in the
rest of you sorry fucking bastards.

620
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,041
I'm fighting for a free Ireland.

621
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
And that includes you.

622
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,550
You cunt.

623
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,951
So you better start showing
me some fucking respect.

624
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,180
What did he tell you?

625
00:47:21,245 --> 00:47:22,530
He said nothing.

626
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,150
I'm not stupid Darren.

627
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,750
I read the payer's.

628
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,650
I'm okay.

629
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,870
I'm okay.

630
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,050
Here, you swam most days.

631
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,110
Maybe you're fucking drowned.

632
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,550
Jesus, here we're going
to let your age get to you.

633
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,561
I suppose the front line would
make a decent shout out of anyone.

634
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,170
Now where's Curtis?

635
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,430
Ah, tonight's a bit the last of your life.

636
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,311
You know, I never knew
the hell of war that you did.

637
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,857
For me, the liberation
of France was just a

638
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:44,390
load of faffing about,
from perfectly honest.

639
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,590
But the monkey as well, you can bite.

640
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,346
Well, they certainly weren't up to me.

641
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,370
They feel good about it.

642
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,450
They was determined to help
fight through Nazi bastards,

643
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,410
even if it meant sided with the English.

644
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,490
But that's why I wear the uniform.

645
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:59,790
You know, I know right, I know wrong.

646
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,461
And you need the black and white.

647
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,461
Oh, the state of the North at the minute.

648
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,631
And I've seen that off
fighting for a lifetime.

649
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,550
Hey! There you go.

650
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,150


651
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,691
Did anyone come out here? Does anyone know?

652
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,070
So he could be back in Belfast then.

653
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,710
At the end, they'd fucking
kick him back to him himself.

654
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,801
What if special branches aren't us?

655
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,270
I fuck off!

656
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,860
Just give me something!

657
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,370
Local intel, any names,
round here, someone of no!

658
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,990
Where are you again?

659
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,290
Dang, Glenn, call him.

660
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,370
Let's just suppose.

661
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,970
Based hiding spots, it was
against fucking pronouns.

662
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,100
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
No, stay back.

664
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,080
Robert, my cue? No, I'm not.

665
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720


666
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,160
Before is that happened?

667
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,460
Your, uh, colleague.

668
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,731
What's the specific about
the nature of your visit?

669
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:23,280
Afraid his phone was being tapped
by the big fellas, I suppose, huh?

670
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,240
Oh, bloody paranoid.

671
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,900
Trying to find a friend.

672
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,621
And none know what the shadow is
better than those under their rocks.

673
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Oh, I like that.

674
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

675
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,100
And this friend, what's
the name? Curtis.

676
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,900
Curtis June.

677
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,900


678
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,486
That's a foliar name,
huh? And the June.

679
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800


680
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,140
Hi.

681
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,740
June.

682
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,351
Is it short for something?

683
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,710
What is June?

684
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,420
Is June fucking short for something?

685
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,000
It's June, like the month.

686
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,580
June.

687
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,100
I've never in my life
been anyone called June.

688
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,860
Redhead, tall, skinny fella.

689
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,130
That doesn't ring a bell.

690
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,980
You know, those bandits out there in the
west, they might have heard something.

691
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
You give them a try.

692
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,520
You know, I have to clear up this mess.

693
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,760
If you please, find your own way out.

694
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
My fits.

695
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,291
I said... I heard you.

696
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,391
You're only three foot away from me.

697
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,750
Is he dead?

698
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:05,990
Without a doubt.

699
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,390
I have nothing to do with me.

700
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,990
Who, then?

701
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,270
Ten-year-old blow your fucking head off.

702
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,950
Well, well, well, put it away, will you?

703
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,890
I'm not sticking my life for him.

704
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:25,460
Told him not to do it.

705
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
Who? Finn Maher.

706
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,980


707
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,880
Finn Maher, Murphy.

708
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,700
But we parted ways.

709
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,800
He's no longer in my employ.

710
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,280
Who called the his?

711
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,581
We'd have to ask him that.

712
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,320
Where does he
live? I don't know.

713
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,660


714
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:47,060
Now, if you don't mind, I would be
very grateful if you would get that out.

715
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,730
Robbie?

716
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,381
Robbie's not here anymore.

717
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:19,970
Where is he? I shot him.

718
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:21,950


719
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:24,770
Believe me, he had a comment.

720
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:26,611
I'm not trying to be
disrespectful or nothing.

721
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,770
What's your name, love?

722
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,710
Josie?

723
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,670
You're a sweet voice, Josie.

724
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,281
I'm sure you've done nothing wrong.

725
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,190
But I can't let you go
see in my face now, can I?

726
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,170
No.

727
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,510
So why don't you go into your
bedroom back there, lock your door,

728
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,656
and don't come out until I'm gone?

729
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:56,611
Robbie isn't going anywhere.

730
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Put that away.

731
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,090
Take a look at this.

732
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,150
Blood money.

733
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,430
Fuck him, last I go.

734
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,480
Thanks again, Rita.

735
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,510
Oh, wait a minute.

736
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,830
I'll teach a bit whenever you start
planting, but I can't remember everything.

737
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,770
Looks have done good.

738
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,390
That's a start.

739
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,470
Good night.

740
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,750
Night.

741
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,410
Robbie.

742
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,250
No, no, no.

743
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,650
Mr. McKade, don't.

744
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,310
Robbie was a good man.

745
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:32,586
Of course he fook him, wasn't he?

746
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:32,630
Why?

747
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,970
For what he was, he was a good man.

748
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,050
Did you think who
he was? It was her.

749
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,570
No, I didn't.

750
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,110


751
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,530
She was talking to Robbie, though.

752
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,571
She said she was looking
for someone named Curtis.

753
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,930
The ginger Jesse.

754
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,310
She'll need a show.

755
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,570
We can't stay here.

756
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:52,070
Good.

757
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:53,790
Fucking hate whites.

758
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,226
Going safe in some of the bedroom.

759
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,650
Let's make you go into the kitchen.

760
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:57,290
Please.

761
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,750
All right.

762
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,150
I'll start this out.

763
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,890
Everyone knows each
other in these small towns.

764
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:09,550
They'll know them.

765
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,150
But why does it have to be me?

766
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:12,851
Because you always look lost.

767
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,210
Now go.

768
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,190
Good evening.

769
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:39,245
I'm up for the weekend.

770
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,410
As of my uncle.

771
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,090
We've got a bit turned around.

772
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,671
You wouldn't happen to
know a Finn Bar Murphy.

773
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:48,910
Finn Bar?

774
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,430
No, I'm all right.

775
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:57,810
Object the road there.

776
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,000
Mother fucks you.

777
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:02,180
Gosh.

778
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
Thank you.

779
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,920
Evening, Garda.

780
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,080
The event.

781
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:35,996
You want me to follow
her up? Huh? Yeah.

782
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,140


783
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,320


784
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,691
Never see that fellow around here before.

785
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,440
Never have.

786
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:45,560
this is up to see us,
Uncle Finn, by? Fiber.

787
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:50,220
But, uh, no, Don's never
said he had enough of you.

788
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,940
I suppose they found them.

789
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,380
Maybe you asked this
network a bit to skirt us, fella.

790
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:16,205
Chet on the road after you spoke to them.

791
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,711
Just wait for your outside, then.

792
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
How long you been?

793
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,220
I've been over there.

794
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,310
Something spooky.

795
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:08,870
Somebody's in my house.

796
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,981
Well, that's me and
employed, then I suppose.

797
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,931
Old Robert took advantage
of me, but he treated me right.

798
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,481
You say you was my friend?

799
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,820
We had things in common.

800
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,940
Things to keep hidden.

801
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,620
But you're a runaway.

802
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,806
Your home is an old pilot shooting.

803
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,311
There's no luck to be had out here.
They call it running away.

804
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640
Escaping's more like you.

805
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,760
One night, I got myself
into a fierce post-op in a pub.

806
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,300
But I come out of it on top.

807
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:53,570
And there Robert was.

808
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,571
Buying me as many points as I wanted,

809
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,160
an after-me-tirty quest to
push some fella off up here.

810
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,581
Of course I didn't know he was getting 130,

811
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,611
but that was Robert the
elf's sleeve and bastard.

812
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:10,430
It was easy, money.

813
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,890
And I lost track long ago.

814
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,290
And many have killed.

815
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,150
The war had turned me into
somebody that didn't recognize.

816
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,781
And when I came home and
learned my market had died,

817
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,451
but it was left to my old self.

818
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,571
It seemed to disappear into a black hole.

819
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,270
And then Robert came home.

820
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,570
As he said, it was too easy.

821
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,420
Fuckin' seniors and their raisins.

822
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,160
But he's not here by now.

823
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,720
He's probably like down watching us.

824
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,160
Well, if he is, let's give
him something to watch.

825
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,110
No, it's easier.

826
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,290
Go back inside, Rita.

827
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,690
Please.

828
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:11,300
You must be the nosy fucking neighbor, huh?

829
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:15,151
You should be minding your own
business if you know what's best.

830
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
You know, Fimper?

831
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,580
Never had the pleasure, but I will.

832
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,460
Mr. Murphy has done something.

833
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,460
Something unforgivable.

834
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,340
Hey, what is it?

835
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,521
I'm gonna fucking kill her.

836
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,820
You've got no advantage.

837
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,001
I found it. What's that
water talk? Put it down.

838
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,620
I don't want Rita getting
caught in my crossfire.

839
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,461
God, it's lonely out here.

840
01:03:41,505 --> 01:03:44,120
Especially for a frail
owl one, like yourself.

841
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,620
If you see your friend, you
can give him a message.

842
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,860
I'll tell him a mighty wee bitch, Santa.

843
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,280
Do.

844
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,600
Talk to the crew.

845
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,480
Hold it! Phew.

846
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,140


847
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,671
Do you cut this is down
from the crossroads?

848
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,110
One of the flowers.

849
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,570
And who is this again?

850
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,191
For God's sake, it doesn't matter.

851
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,321
Look, you're a doctor. Just go to her.

852
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,430
All right? Please.

853
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,540
Here we are.

854
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
Home sweet home.

855
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:17,890
Huh.

856
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:19,990
This money's worth here.

857
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,440
No wonder you need someone
to buy your bingo boots.

858
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,530
Maybe I just went to the conversation.

859
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,290
Did you play this thing?

860
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:31,975
Just a card, I too.

861
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,110
No trainer, I want you to teach me stuff.

862
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,040
I'll make my own rack out someday.

863
01:05:44,015 --> 01:05:47,460
Maybe over there in California, if
we can save enough for the journey.

864
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,440
People over there just
seem free or something.

865
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,600
Enjoying life, you know what I mean?

866
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,261
The teams, that's...
Oh, hey, let's go.

867
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:36,851
There's Dr. Ocogli, you've
earned the paper before.

868
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,771
I don't recall you being sober.

869
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,520
Hey, what?

870
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,200
Hey.

871
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,871
It was 20-year-old yesterday.

872
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,440
Feenborough.

873
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:01,430
The poor fellow must have been a hermit
out there, for I never saw him in the town.

874
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,580
Went to the name of Robert McHugh.

875
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,860
Did you know him at all? Mm-hmm.

876
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,420


877
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,120
The mother said that there
was a woman that did the killing.

878
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,681
I can't make a head
in her tail a bit at all.

879
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,020
You know, I was wondering if maybe
the same had something to do with it.

880
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,360
You know, maybe the same was the same.

881
01:07:21,795 --> 01:07:24,200
Anyway, we'll get the
detectives down from Dublin.

882
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,260
There'll be all over it.

883
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,820
There'll be nothing for me to do.

884
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,700
Oh, here.

885
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,100
You never told me you had an FU.

886
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,020
Oh, nice lad.

887
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,260
I don't see him that much.

888
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,900
You mind dropping me
by some notes? Oh, get in.

889
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,380
Well.

890
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:51,850
..

891
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,690
It's yours for the ride, Vinny.

892
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,990
Yeah, hey.

893
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,470
Don't be smug about it.

894
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,961
Can't be seem to have favorites.

895
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,550
Get on with it.

896
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,400
Stay.

897
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,760
No.

898
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,990
Stay out of sight.

899
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,591
You come to a fucking football match.

900
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,640
He'd be here.

901
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:09,630
Ruts.

902
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,411
We're gonna wear fucking ruts.

903
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,311
They didn't get your good side.

904
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,400
This pushes us in the corner.

905
01:09:17,401 --> 01:09:18,481
We're gonna have to leg it.

906
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,540
Not yet.

907
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,400
Anybody can recognize a storm.

908
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,780
Curtis is dead.

909
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,660
Try to give in ounces, shit.

910
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:34,551
Let's burn the fucker's
place to go around for Curtis.

911
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,820
Let me get out of here.

912
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,036
We'll get the Amsterdam France.

913
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:38,861
Maybe we've got that
money we can start over.

914
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,761
Have you lost your fucking mind?

915
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,080
Run off and leave Ireland.

916
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,216
So what's the point of all this day?

917
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:46,780
If we want to live.

918
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,260
So they died for nothing.

919
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,591
For a while, nothing's settled down.

920
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,300
Am I the only one who understands
what we're fighting for here?

921
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,480
We're not fucking leaving.

922
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,900
Someone hired Murphy to kill Curtis.

923
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,100
We need to find out who.

924
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,060
The old lady, the fucking shopkeeper,

925
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,820
someone knows where he is.

926
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,691
We're just gonna have to pry it from her.

927
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,540
Better find the loo.

928
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,141
Maybe the two of you can come up
with just one fucking idea while I'm gone.

929
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,580
Fimba!

930
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,040
What's that? My biggest fan.

931
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:39,910


932
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,560
She's stuck around.

933
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,200
What do you think?

934
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,800
It all looks so blood-testy.

935
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,060
I don't know who to root for.

936
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,520
Hey, Snaya.

937
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,720
What about you,
Fimba? Not too bad.

938
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,760
Be morea.

939
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:51,860


940
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,820
Look, she's around here somewhere.

941
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,060
Up to something, I'm sure.

942
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:56,080
She's grand.

943
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:57,540
We're good.

944
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,180
Good.

945
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,460
Okay, I'll see.

946
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
See you later tonight.

947
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Hi.

948
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,430
Fimba, Murphy.

949
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,670
Dear and my cat.

950
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,610
It's Darren.

951
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,141
I've only seen her printed.

952
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,401
And they've printed a lot of a you, lady.

953
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,331
You tell me who ordered the hit,

954
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:56,430
or I'll put you down right
here to die in this shit-fed turf.

955
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,030
Look, we've killed each other's friends.

956
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:00,031
One for the other.

957
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:00,970
That's true, though.

958
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,250
I walk away.

959
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:02,790
I know.

960
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,570
No, no, no. Fuck you.

961
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,330
I killed a degenerate bottom feeder.

962
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,690
Curtis was my brother.

963
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,790
Then you must have
known about his tendencies.

964
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Give me the name.

965
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,660
Easy.

966
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,360
All right.

967
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,020
I can bring him to you.

968
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,300
Easier that way.

969
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,200
And you're just going to have
this, whoever turned him's over.

970
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,280
Convinced your boy into a car, didn't I?

971
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,020
I'll be back here.

972
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,440
Yeah, it's back.

973
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,620
I'll be quiet.

974
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,140
No one else.

975
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:38,670
Oh, fuck right off.

976
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,780
Do you think I'm stupid?

977
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:43,690
We made it that pub.

978
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Rights? That's it.

979
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,180


980
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,080
Full of merry fucking
villagers about that time.

981
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,740
None of who suspect you're a
murderer and bastard, I suppose.

982
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,240
So no tricks.

983
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,001
They won't have you hurting
anyone else in this time.

984
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:57,500
Do you hear me?

985
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,720
You'll be there.

986
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:02,240
Or we leave a special delivery
that'll blow that pub on over Donegal.

987
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,530
That happens to us.

988
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,300
People will come looking.

989
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,960
People are not worse than me.

990
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,820
And they'll tear right through
this guard for sake and place.

991
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,540
And that quaint little
nosy neighbor made yours.

992
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,470
No one will be safe.

993
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,340
Fuck it, Aegis.

994
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,360
Like a sound, you hear
that thing is in your ear.

995
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,120
But you can't forget from sundown songs.

996
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,000
It's all in the head,
you're ready everywhere.

997
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,120
No matter what you do, it's
gonna run around the whole door.

998
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,460
You take my pistol and nip off with a pit?

999
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,341
Certainly into your dramatic extension.

1000
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,140
I find the leader.

1001
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:59,491
She didn't take to my ceasefire.

1002
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,420
She'll let me know it's yours.

1003
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,680
I'm gonna finish her.

1004
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,640
Finish all of them.

1005
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,391
What's your plan on doing, Da?

1006
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,060
It'll be good and public.

1007
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:13,320
So if anyone comes looking
for blood, come for me.

1008
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,280
Leave this time out of it.

1009
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,540
You can go.

1010
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:17,900
I'll be fine my own.

1011
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,420
No way, Jose.

1012
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,760
The great sin by Murphy's going to war.

1013
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,860
I'll be fucked if we
miss never at all the fun.

1014
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,760
Good boy.

1015
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,540
Good dog.

1016
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,740
Oh, yeah.

1017
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
Can we gift for you?

1018
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,380
Well, you take him.

1019
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,540
He's yours.

1020
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,320
What's his name?

1021
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,501
You know, I never gave him a name.

1022
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
What do you think?

1023
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,180
He looks like a Sean.

1024
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:58,940
Hi.

1025
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:01,031
He'll take good care of him, won't he?

1026
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,640
It's good to care.

1027
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,240
Even if it hurts.

1028
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,480
It keeps you human.

1029
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,400
Okay.

1030
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:10,620
Bye, Sean.

1031
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,900
You want an audience?

1032
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,800
I'll meet them inside.

1033
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,080
Tell them I've got to fly it back.

1034
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,600
Or I'll be waiting for them.

1035
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
That's an advantage.

1036
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,500
See?

1037
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,440
I was listening.

1038
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,920
No.

1039
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,231
I have an advantage in my own.

1040
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:03,320
Go on now.

1041
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,500
Take this.

1042
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,341
There's an envelope in the outer pocket.

1043
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,471
Give it to Robert's mother for me.

1044
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,580
The rest is yours.

1045
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,760
What are you getting now?

1046
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,860
We agreed with him.

1047
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,920
We agreed on nothing.

1048
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,420
Now listen.

1049
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,061
There's nothing more here for you now.

1050
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,420
This is my war.

1051
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,180
Take that money.

1052
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,140
Let it be my hand down to you.

1053
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,300
You don't have to use that ever again.

1054
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,380
You're young.

1055
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,961
I need something else today.

1056
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,300
Get the color from me.

1057
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,821
I'm not saying you need to be
able to see it around like that.

1058
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,541
It's just the wish there life doing this.

1059
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,141
Nobody have a gaming unit.

1060
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,621
My advice is more if I did than that money.

1061
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:57,350
Trust me on this.

1062
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,150
Go on.

1063
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,370
Hi, Jesus.

1064
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:56,980
Don't be denied that way.

1065
01:17:56,981 --> 01:17:57,981
Too expensive.

1066
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:58,680
I've got no heart.

1067
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,060
I have to be young.

1068
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:00,380
Spread it.

1069
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:00,780
Come on.

1070
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Sit down with you.

1071
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,770
Black Star isn't a truth.

1072
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:18,451
You didn't try adding out
the pitch? No, the crowd.

1073
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,750
Right.

1074
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,750


1075
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,850
I have a peep in first Conan.

1076
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,250
You've been the case in after.

1077
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,430
I am.

1078
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,191
Because you're shit with a pistol.

1079
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,941
Because I went looking for
Curtis with no help from you.

1080
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,470
Because I organized this trade.

1081
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:36,070
And because I fucking said so.

1082
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:39,190
Fine.

1083
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:40,931
Just keep the car in these.

1084
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:45,550
Annie found play you set that timer
and we get the fuck out of your ear.

1085
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,750
Scorched a bastard.

1086
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,091
So off of the licks, isn't it?

1087
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,321
And someone can hang those
dead kids round our necks.

1088
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,450
I'd hope for a quieter night.

1089
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,070
I know a few stories, but it'll be yours.

1090
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,601
Hey, you're getting on
with your own Russian book.

1091
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,110
I've finished it yet.

1092
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:08,270
I didn't say you would enjoy it, though.

1093
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:09,150
Oh.

1094
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:10,710
Been a mystery.

1095
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:11,770
Been three, you know.

1096
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,010
All right.

1097
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:16,270
There's a clever detective
investigating the grace of murder.

1098
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:22,550
Name of Porphyry is tenacious
in his quest with the truth.

1099
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:28,390
Drawing out of this aspect, I'm
with his isolations destroying him.

1100
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:31,330
Heading away at him.

1101
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,130
I can't understand that the priority ended.

1102
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,210
It's all right.

1103
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,500
She came in stinks.

1104
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:45,110
Nice detective.

1105
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,370
It reminds me of you, actually.

1106
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,031
Did you get his mind
in the end? I don't know.

1107
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,550


1108
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,521
Will your nephew be in tonight?

1109
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,620
Or has he moved on?

1110
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:15,660
You don't trade books for a living.

1111
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,620
Do you feel, Mark?

1112
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,370
What is it that you do?

1113
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Really?

1114
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,080
You don't want to know.

1115
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,060
If you need to tell me
something, I could help.

1116
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,180
Jesus.

1117
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:50,700
Why? Why? Come on.

1118
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,080


1119
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,260


1120
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,040
You have to scoot on.

1121
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,980
Where are you going?

1122
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,160
This is no place for me.

1123
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,900
Put him on the bar.

1124
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:57,140
No, no.

1125
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:57,780
Not tonight.

1126
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:00,540
I just want Sean to be
in him, ah? Not tonight.

1127
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,320


1128
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,760
Take Sean and go home now.

1129
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,836
But I... Sean can meet
your master mother tonight.

1130
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,080
Okay? Go home.

1131
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:05,700


1132
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,120
No.

1133
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:35,060
Why not? See you later.

1134
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400


1135
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:21,090
Why is there a crowd?

1136
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:22,690
Why?

1137
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:24,390
Your partner's in crime.

1138
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,530
He's had no funny business.

1139
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,710
They're around to be sure of us.

1140
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,970
They're just produced the fucker, like you
said, and you can get back to your music.

1141
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,630
We'll meet out back where
we can hear ourselves.

1142
01:23:36,631 --> 01:23:39,930
You moved from that fucking
spot, and I promise you,

1143
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,090
I'll shoot you dead.

1144
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,480
All right, it was me.

1145
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,300
Don't you love how a song can just
fill your hair with joy? Ha? The music.

1146
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,700


1147
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,540


1148
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,260
Flicks you want to just
grab one of the nearest

1149
01:24:00,261 --> 01:24:02,000
young dolls and kiss
the face clean arper.

1150
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:03,520
This how you can't score it.

1151
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:03,900
And we're doing it.

1152
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,600
Aren't I a bit ripe for your tongue?

1153
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,400
Ah.

1154
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:10,000
They'd care to get any
woman who's up for a...

1155
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:11,620
Darren?

1156
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,621
Rightful for your charity, Finn Bird.

1157
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,251
But I think it's got to
be a singer first, only.

1158
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:20,760
This him? And I'm done.

1159
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:21,540
I told you.

1160
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:22,500
It was me.

1161
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:22,880
Course it's me.

1162
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:23,940


1163
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,981
Now, why don't we all
go out back and... Whoa!

1164
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,140
No!

1165
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,960
Don't!

1166
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:56,020
It's mine, you bastard.

1167
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,560
Don't bitch!

1168
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,640
She shot me!

1169
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,740
Just letting your own
shit in there, Darren!

1170
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,680
No!

1171
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:35,730
Why the fuck did you come back?

1172
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,370
What's that? Stay down! Stay down!

1173
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,901
Oh yeah, money's in me care.

1174
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,501
Guessin' you're gonna have
to cut up a farm yet before me.

1175
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Finbar?

1176
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:51,411
You lookin' for him to see of you.

1177
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,890
I'm not the one who needs saving.

1178
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:59,110
You've done what I've done.

1179
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:01,730
I have no reasons.

1180
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,890
And the Lord who's them.

1181
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:11,371
I see no judgment from you.

1182
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:14,950
I'm not here to judge.

1183
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,081
We've all got our reasons.

1184
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,400
Just shoot me.

1185
01:31:27,401 --> 01:31:31,800
You're at your hand.

1186
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,300
Make your peace.

1187
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,140
My brother.

1188
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:48,750
He's all alone.

1189
01:31:54,655 --> 01:31:55,776
I'll make sure you join him.

1190
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,370
His roots didn't get you.

1191
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:02,010
Rita, I am so sorry.

1192
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,330
It's fine, Finbar.

1193
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:08,411
You never asked me what I did for a living.

1194
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:11,310
Should I have? I see him.

1195
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,370
Nothing grew.

1196
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:20,310
I started it a days ago.

1197
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:22,190
Whoa.

1198
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,070
No, you keep it.

1199
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,630
Maybe somewhere down
the road you'll try again.

1200
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,090
Why, Rita?

1201
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:43,460
You take care of him.

1202
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:00,590
You take care of him.
